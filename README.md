## Getting Started

### Production mode
```sh
$ yarn run production
```

This will optimise all assets and code. After the production you can run `$ yarn run serve` to see the web app running.


### Development mode
```sh
$ yarn run development
```
This runs the webpack-dev-server, now you can contribute to the web app.
